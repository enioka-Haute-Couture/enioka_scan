This application is a demo for enioka Scan, a library that makes the integration of all barcode scanners easy in any Android application, avoiding vendor lock-in and lowering the cost of advanced scanner integration.

It is compatible with a wide variety of scanning devices, integrated or external, from different vendors such as Zebra, Honeywell, Athesi and more.

When there are no compatible hardware devices available, the library provides a camera reader based on ZBar (default) or ZXing.

Through a common abstraction, it provides access to the following methods (provided the hardware supports them):

- press/release the scanner's trigger
- pause/resume scanning abilities
- disconnect/reconnect scanners
- enable/disable illumination from the scanner
- enable/disable colored LEDs
- set scanner enabled symbologies

Finally, it provides a ready to use Service that handles scanner lifecycles, as well as a template Activity, allowing you to use scanners in a matter of minutes.

This app includes all of the library's compatibility modules.
